- IF YOU RUN THE PROGRAM, YOU WILL BE ASKED TO ENTER A BOARD NAME. I ATTACHED 5 SAMPLE BOARDS FOR CONVENIENCE.

- WIDTH OF THE BOARD IS IMPORTANT AND NOW, IT IS PRE-DEFINED AS PER SAMPLE BOARDS. YOU CAN CHANGE ANYTIME BY COMMENTING OUT
MY CODE AND DE-COMMENT THE CODE THAT I LEFT FOR DIFFERENT WIDTH TAKING FOR DIFFERENT BOARDS.

- I USED HEAPQ LIBRARY TO MAKE PUSH AND POP OPERATIONS.I COULD'VE USED DIFFERENT LIBRARIES TOO. FOR EXAMPLE, 
I TRIED DEEP COPY ADDITION TO FRONTIER. YOU CAN ALWAYS DE-COMMENT WHAT I WROTE TO TEST IT. I EVEN LEFT IMPORT STATEMENT 
FOR CONVENIENCE. HOWEVER, THE REASON WHY I OPTED FOR HEAPQ IS PERFORMANCE. EVEN IN ONE LINE OF CODE CHANGE, PERFORMANCE GOT 2 TIMES
WORSE MEANING COMPLETION TIME TOOK 2 TIMES MORE.

- TIME AND MEMORY CONSUMPTION INFO ARE IN THE WORD DOCUMENT. I REMOVED THE CODE FOR PROFILING FROM MY SUBMISSION.
